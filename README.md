## Introduction: The Future of Customer Support is Here

Imagine calling your insurance company and being instantly connected to a team of specialists—each an expert in their domain—working together seamlessly to resolve your query. No more endless transfers, no more repeating your story. This is the promise of **multi-agent AI systems**.

In this article, I'll walk you through building a sophisticated multi-agent insurance support system that intelligently routes customer queries to specialized agents, retrieves information from databases, and leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for accurate responses.

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

Our system features:

1. **Supervisor Agent** - The orchestrator that analyzes user intent and routes to appropriate specialists
2. **Policy Agent** - Handles policy details, coverage, and auto insurance specifics
3. **Billing Agent** - Manages billing inquiries, payment history, and invoice information
4. **Claims Agent** - Processes claim status and filing assistance
5. **General Help Agent** - Answers FAQs using RAG with a vector database
6. **Human Escalation Agent** - Gracefully hands off complex cases to human representatives

The system uses **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration, **ChromaDB** for semantic search, **SQLite** for structured data, and **OpenAI GPT** for natural language understanding.

    Billing --> Supervisor
    Claims --> Supervisor
    General --> Supervisor
    
    Supervisor --> Final
    Final --> End[End]
    Human --> End
```

The workflow operates as a **state machine** where:
- Each agent is a node in the graph
- The supervisor makes routing decisions
- Specialists return to the supervisor after completing their tasks
- The conversation ends when the query is resolved or escalated

---

## 🧠 The Core Components

### 1. State Management with TypedDict

We define a comprehensive state that tracks the entire conversation:

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[Any], add_messages]
    user_input: str
    conversation_history: Optional[str]
    
    # Context extraction
    customer_id: Optional[str]
    policy_number: Optional[str]
    claim_id: Optional[str]
    
    # Routing
    next_agent: Optional[str]
    task: Optional[str]
    
    # Escalation
    requires_human_escalation: bool
    escalation_reason: Optional[str]
```

This state is passed between agents, accumulating context and maintaining conversation coherence.

### 2. Intelligent Routing with the Supervisor

The supervisor agent is the brain of the operation:

```python
def supervisor_agent(state):
    # Extract context from conversation history
    user_query = state["user_input"]
    conversation_history = state.get("conversation_history", "")
    
    # Check for existing context (policy number, customer ID)
    policy_number = state.get("policy_number")
    customer_id = state.get("customer_id")
    
    # Make routing decision using LLM
    prompt = SUPERVISOR_PROMPT.format(
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        policy_number=policy_number or "Not provided",
        customer_id=customer_id or "Not provided"
    )
    
    # LLM returns JSON with next_agent and task
    decision = run_llm_with_tools(prompt, tools, tool_functions)
    
    return {
        "next_agent": decision["next_agent"],
        "task": decision["task"]
    }
```

The supervisor:
- Analyzes user intent
- Checks available context
- Avoids redundant clarification questions
- Routes to the most appropriate specialist

### 3. Specialized Agent Tools

Each agent has access to specific tools for database queries:

**Policy Agent Tools:**
```python
def get_policy_details(policy_number: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Fetch policy details from SQLite"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect('insurance_support.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT p.*, c.first_name, c.last_name 
        FROM policies p 
        JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id 
        WHERE p.policy_number = ?
    """, (policy_number,))
    # Return policy data
```

**Billing Agent Tools:**
```python
def get_billing_info(policy_number: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Retrieve billing information"""
    # Query billing table for pending invoices
    
def get_payment_history(policy_number: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get recent payment records"""
    # Query payment history
```

These tools enable agents to access real data and provide accurate, personalized responses.

### 4. RAG-Powered General Help with ChromaDB

The General Help Agent uses retrieval-augmented generation:

```python
def general_help_agent_node(state):
    user_query = state.get("user_input")
    
    # Step 1: Retrieve relevant FAQs from ChromaDB
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=[user_query],
        n_results=3,
        include=["metadatas", "documents", "distances"]
    )
    
    # Step 2: Format retrieved context
    faq_context = format_faqs(results)
    
    # Step 3: Generate response with LLM
    prompt = GENERAL_HELP_PROMPT.format(
        task=state["task"],
        conversation_history=state["conversation_history"],
        faq_context=faq_context
    )
    
    answer = llm_without_tool(prompt)
    return {"messages": [("assistant", answer)]}
```

This approach ensures factual accuracy by grounding responses in actual FAQ data.

## 📊 Data Infrastructure

### Synthetic Data Generation

We generate realistic insurance data with 1,000 customers and multiple policies:

```python
def generate_sample_data():
    # Generate customers with random names
    customers = pd.DataFrame({
        'customer_id': [f'CUST{str(i).zfill(5)}' for i in range(1, 1001)],
        'first_name': [random.choice(first_names) for _ in range(1000)],
        'last_name': [random.choice(last_names) for _ in range(1000)],
        'email': [f'user{i}@example.com' for i in range(1, 1001)],
        # ... more fields
    })
    
    # Generate 1,500 policies (auto, home, life)
    # Generate billing records, payments, claims, etc.
```

### Database Schema

The SQLite database includes:
- **customers** - Customer profiles
- **policies** - Policy details (type, premium, status)
- **auto_policy_details** - Vehicle-specific data
- **billing** - Invoice and due dates
- **payments** - Payment transactions
- **claims** - Claim records and status
- **claim_documents** - Supporting documentation

### Vector Database for FAQs

ChromaDB stores insurance Q&A pairs with semantic embeddings:

```python
# Load insurance FAQ dataset
df = load_dataset("deccan-ai/insuranceQA-v2")

# Create ChromaDB collection
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="insurance_FAQ_collection")

# Add FAQ documents with metadata
collection.add(
    documents=df["combined"].tolist(),
    metadatas=[{"question": q, "answer": a} for q, a in zip(df["input"], df["output"])],
    ids=df.index.astype(str).tolist()
)
```

## 🔧 LangGraph Workflow Implementation

LangGraph orchestrates the agent interactions:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

workflow = StateGraph(GraphState)

# Add all agent nodes
workflow.add_node("supervisor_agent", supervisor_agent)
workflow.add_node("policy_agent", policy_agent_node)
workflow.add_node("billing_agent", billing_agent_node)
workflow.add_node("claims_agent", claims_agent_node)
workflow.add_node("general_help_agent", general_help_agent_node)
workflow.add_node("human_escalation_agent", human_escalation_node)

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("supervisor_agent")

# Define routing logic
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "supervisor_agent",
    decide_next_agent,
    {
        "policy_agent": "policy_agent",
        "billing_agent": "billing_agent",
        "claims_agent": "claims_agent",
        "general_help_agent": "general_help_agent",
        "human_escalation_agent": "human_escalation_agent",
        "end": END
    }
)

# Specialists return to supervisor
for agent in ["policy_agent", "billing_agent", "claims_agent", "general_help_agent"]:
    workflow.add_edge(agent, "supervisor_agent")

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()
```

## 💡 Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Context Preservation**

The system maintains conversation context across agent transitions:

```python
# Each agent updates conversation history
updated_state["conversation_history"] = (
    current_history + f"\n{agent_name}: {response}"
)
```

This prevents users from repeating information and enables natural multi-turn conversations.

### 2. **Minimal Clarification Strategy**

The supervisor only asks for essential missing information:

```python
# Supervisor checks existing context before asking
if policy_number or customer_id:
    # Route directly to specialist
else:
    # Ask for minimal required info (≤15 words)
```

### 3. **Tool-Calling Pattern**

Agents use function calling to access data:

```python
def run_llm_with_tools(prompt, tools, tool_functions):
    # Step 1: Ask LLM with tool availability
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}],
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto"
    )
    
    # Step 2: Execute requested tools
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        result = tool_functions[tool_call.function.name](**args)
    
    # Step 3: Return final answer with tool results
    return final_response
```

### 4. **Logging and Observability**

Comprehensive logging tracks system behavior:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('insurance_agent.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

logger.info(f"🔍 Fetching policy details for: {policy_number}")
logger.warning(f"❌ Policy not found: {policy_number}")
```

## 🚀 Example Interactions

### Query 1: Billing Information

```
User: "What is my premium for auto insurance?"
Supervisor: Routes to billing_agent
Billing Agent: Asks for policy number
User: "POL000123"
Billing Agent: Returns "$250/month, due on 15th"
```

### Query 2: General FAQ

```
User: "What does life insurance cover?"
Supervisor: Routes to general_help_agent
General Help Agent: 
  - Retrieves top 3 relevant FAQs from ChromaDB
  - Synthesizes answer from retrieved context
  - Responds with accurate information
```

### Query 3: Complex Escalation

```
User: "I want to speak to a manager about my denied claim"
Supervisor: Detects escalation intent
Human Escalation Agent: 
  - Acknowledges frustration
  - Confirms human handoff
  - Logs escalation reason
```
